# Cosmetics-Products-Management-System

#### Cosmetics and Beauty Product Online Store in PHP/OOP Free Source Code

### Introduction
Cosmetics & Beauty Product Online Store is the name of this initiative. A MySQL database stores the data used in this PHP/OOP project. The Cosmetics and Beauty Products Business can take advantage of this web-based solution. Users of this app are able to peruse the wares of the aforementioned company and make purchases directly from the app. Among its many benefits and functionalities is the ability to accept payments online through the PayPal API. Thanks to the AdminLTE Template and the Bootstrap Framework, it offers a nice user interface. Its features and functionalities are intended for easy use by users.

### About the Cosmetics and Beauty Product Online Store
I developed this project using the following:

XAMPP v8.2.12 as my local webserver that contains a PHP Version 8.2.12

      PHP Language
      MySQL Database
      HTML CSS JavaScript
      jQuery
      Ajax Bootstrap
      AdminLTE
The Cosmetics and Beauty Product Online Store Project offers 2 user interfaces. Ones are for the management which is the Admin Panel of the system. This side of the system can be viewed by the management. The Admin is in charge of handling all the critical lists or data in the system such as the list of products and orders. The Admin can also manage the supplies of the products according to their variant. The other side is for the client-side. This side is open to anyone but some of the features are visible and operating for registered clients only. The possible clients can simply register their account in order to order their preferred products. The system may provide a printable date-wise sales report. The online payment option only supports utilizing PayPal API.
